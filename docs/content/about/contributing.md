# __Contributing to NeoGPT__ :heart_on_fire:

We welcome contributions from the community to help improve and enhance our project. Please take a moment to review this document to understand how you can contribute effectively.


## General Guidelines
1. Keep the code clean and readable.
2. Follow the existing code style and formatting guidelines in the project to maintain consistency.
3. Keep the feature small and focused. It is more likely to get merged if it is small and focused.
4. Make sure you run pre-commit hooks before committing your code. This will ensure that your code is formatted correctly and passes all the tests.

## Reporting Issues
If you encounter a bug, have a feature request, or want to suggest an improvement, please open an issue on our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/neokd/NeoGPT/issues/new). When reporting an issue, be sure to provide as much as detail as possible, including

- Operating System.
- Version of Python.
- Detailed description of the problem.
- Examples for reproducing the error. You can post pictures, but if specific text or code is required to reproduce the issue, please provide the text in a plain text format for easy copy/paste.

More the information you provide, easier it will be for us to reproduce the issue and fix it.

## Pull Requests

We encourage you to contribute code to NeoGPT through pull requests. To do so, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the NeoGPT repository to your own GitHub account.

2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.

3. Create a new branch for your changes: `git checkout -b featurename`.

4. Install the pre-commit: `pip install pre-commit`

    1. Once you have installed the pre-commit, run `pre-commit install` to install the git hooks.Now, every time you commit, the hooks will run and check your code. If they fail, you will need to fix them before you can commit.

    2. In case you want to run the hooks manually, run `pre-commit run --all-files` to run the hooks on all files.

5. Push your changes to your forked repository.

6. Create a pull request to merge your changes into the NeoGPT repository.


We will review your PR, provide feedback, and merge it if it meets our guidelines.
